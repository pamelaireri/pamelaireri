## About
Fall 2019 Software Engineering Grad with 2 years of Program and Project Management related experience serving Fortune 500 companies. 

I have collaborated with cross-functional teams from beginning to end during the software development life cycle. In addition to providing development teams with statement-of-work, direction, guidance, training, conflict resolution, and defined code requirements. I find it rewarding to help teams adopt emerging technology, improve transparency, increase productivity, resolve development issues, and deliver projects on time within budget. 

Currently seeking a role that combines my project management experience, software engineering competencies, and customer-centric obsession with product development. If you have an opportunity or would like to cross collaborate, email me: pamelaireri@gmail.com.
