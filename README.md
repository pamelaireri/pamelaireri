## about
Three Years of Project Management experience and Technology Consulting serving Fortune 500 customers. I just completed my Computer Science Degree in the Fall of 2019. I love developing products, writing code, creating web and mobile applications, and working with technology.

In my past roles, I have excelled at project management, dealing with customized product development. As the project leader, I have handled everything from the beginning through completion. I worked closely with the developers providing statement-of-work, direction, guidance, training, and defined code requirements. I find it rewarding to see a vision come to life.

Currently, I seek a role that combines my software engineering competencies and customer-centric obsession with project management. I am fascinated by AI, Machine Learning, and IoT. I can easily relocate or do remote work. If you have a job I should consider, email me: pamelaireri@gmail.com.
